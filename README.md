# Vestiges of Tomorrow

A tech and magic modpack for 1.20.1

Currently heavily WIP

### TODO
- [x] Fix up Wizards Reborn recipes to use tags instead of items
- [ ] Include and setup some kind of stages mod perhaps.
- [ ] Setup Farmer's Delight and Let's Do as step 0
- [ ] Setup Theurgy and Wizards Reborn as step 1.
- [ ] Figure out what the next step is. I'm between Embers and Immersive Engineering.
- [ ] Introduce Create and Create Metallurgy as well.
- > Possibly replace Create Metallurgy with Embers Press?
- [ ] Integrate a way to move from 3rd step to HV
- [ ] Integrate Twilight Forest in this tier. Gate AE2 behind it.
- [ ] Figure out a way to generate EU from Wissen.
- [ ] Stage lock Botania.
- [ ] Gate IV behind Botania.
- [ ] Alter IV machinery to require Botania materials.
- [ ] Possibly EU from Botania Mana via a Multiblock.
- [ ] Possibly mana-wissen interop.
- [ ] Write the quests up to and including IV for a start.
- > A lot of the gregtech side of it can be based on the community pack.pa
