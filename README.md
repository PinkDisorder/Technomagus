# Vestiges of Tomorrow

A tech and magic modpack for 1.20.1

Currently heavily WIP

## TODO

- [ ] Fix up Theurgy recipes to use tags instead of items
- [ ] Fix up Wizards Reborn recipes to use tags instead of items
- [ ] Figure out how to completely remove the steam age from gregtech.
- [ ] Setup Farmer's Delight and Let's Do as step 0
- [ ] Setup Theurgy as the first step.
- [ ] Setup Wizards Reborn as the second step.
- [ ] Figure out what the 3rd step is. I'm between Embers and Immersive Engineering.
- [ ] In step 3, introduce Create and Create Metallurgy as well. Possibly replace Create Metallurgy with Embers Press?
- [ ] Integrate a way to move from 3rd step to HV
- [ ] In HV AE2 is accessible, figure out a Twilight Forest boss loot gate.
- [ ] Possibly EU from Wissen.
- [ ] Make accessing IV require Botania stuff.
- [ ] Possibly EU from Botania Mana via a Multiblock.
- [ ] Write the quests up to IV for a start. A lot of the gregtech side of it can be based on the community pack.
- [ ] Figure out how to integrate Better Nether and Better End both of which come with their own progression
